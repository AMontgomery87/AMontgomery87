- 👋 Hi, I’m @AMontgomery87
- 👀 I’m interested in almost everything from programming and math to combat sports like BJJ, Judo, and Muay Thai
- 🌱 I’m currently learning intermediate python, C, Linux CLI and GUIs with Tkinter, as well as a crash course in mathematics/statistics to refresh and learn more data science topics as well. I'm taking CS50 to prepare me for my CSC B.S and M.S. and taking required mathematics courses at a local community college.

- 💞️ I’m not sure I'm ready to collaborate yet, but give me a few months.
- 📫 How to reach me email me at andrewmontgomery87@icloud.com, still working on my linkedin profile
