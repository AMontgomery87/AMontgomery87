- 👋 Hi, I’m @AMontgomery87
- 👀 I’m interested in almost everything from computer sciences on both hardware and software side to combat sports. I've always been a tinkerer from as young as I can remember.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning intermediate python, C, Linux CLI and GUIs with Tkinter/Python, as well as a crash course in mathematics/statistics to refresh and learn more data science topics as well. I'm taking CS50 to prepare me for my CSC B.S and M.S. at the University of Southern Mississippi (starting August 2024) and currently taking trigonometry at Pearl River Community College. My contributions may be slower during times when class is in session. 
I'm planning on focusing on Embedded Systems/Embedded Software for my degree, while working on some side projects in Java/Android to hopefully gain the knowledge base to integrate better with US DOD projects implementing Android.

- 💞️ I’m not sure I'm ready to collaborate yet, but give me a few months.
